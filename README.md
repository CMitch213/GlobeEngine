## Description
This is a game engine that I made in a computer programming class. 
This was my first real experience using C++ in the past I've only used C#, Java, Python. and Web Dev. 
Once the course is over I will be adding some of my own features to make it even more fun and efficient to develop with.

## About-Me
I am a highschool back-end dev and game dev, this was made in a programming course that I took.
This was the first game engine that I have ever made.
If you enjoy this or find it helpful that is awesome! I am mainly using this to develop skills and get better at computer programming.

## TL:DR
Just a fun little game engine I made in a course with some additions by me.
